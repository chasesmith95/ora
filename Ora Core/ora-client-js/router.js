The router is going to serve as the API gateway for the Ora Network

It will act as a server that takes REST Calls, and then broadcasts them
by using the Ora Client

It will run in a container that can be deployed to multiple clouds,
each one image will have config vars and must be subscribed to specific
chains in order to broadcast the transactions.
